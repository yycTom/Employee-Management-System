## This is a project about a Employee Management System. I use Spring boot + React to complete this project.

### I recommend use Intellj to do Spring boot part and VS code to do React part.

## Here are some functions:

### 1. Employee List

### 2. Update employee info

### 3. Delete employee info

### 4. View Employee info
